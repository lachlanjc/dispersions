In April 2020, as the pandemic hit home, I suddenly had an intuition about a metaphoric connection between the behavior of the materials in my drawings, and the phenomena associated with COVID-19. I could no longer watch a sheet of paper trap a cloud of powdered graphite particles, or follow a rivulet of safflower oil gathering color on its travels, without seeing them as visualizations of aerosol dispersions or tangential infection.

What began as a few medium-scale drawings became a major, year-long project of some fifty works, created on large sheets of Arches paper (130&nbsp;×&nbsp;92 cm, 51&nbsp;×&nbsp;36 in) specifically designed for oil paint. In the making, there was an exhilarating sense of generative urgency that seemed to lead from one work to the next. In retrospect, the drawings seem to fall into groups as the working process generated new modes of material handling and technique, and I searched for ways to give shape and form not only to the dangerously invisible, but to create a record of a moment beyond our comprehension.
