When gathering source material for his paintings, Campbell often immerses himself in nature, working outdoors in all seasons and weather. There, he finds endlessly surprising structural configurations and chords of color. He frequently makes drawings and paintings on site, taking advantage of natural light. He also uses high-resolution digital cameras as a supplement to observation, harvesting color and form for later study in a manner analogous to musical sampling.

While Campbell usually works on linen canvas mounted on aluminum composite panels, for the COVID-19 drawings, he chose to work on a special paper from the Arches paper mill, with a softer, more vulnerable surface. Paper retains the trace of the lightest touch, and its subtle grain sometimes puts the physics of materials unexpectedly on display.

His primary painting tools are a set of thin stainless steel blades that register minute changes in pressure and modulation, as well as a set of long branches, to which he attaches charcoal, pencils or brushes. A variety of resins and painting media allow the artist to create dispersions of oil paint and powdered pigments in layered and micro-thin films that frequently possess a subtle luminosity.
