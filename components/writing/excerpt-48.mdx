  For Covid #48, I started drawing with a small brush at the end of a long, slender
  branch, working from a photograph of a mouldering oak, downed by lightning.

  My works don’t typically begin with a subject or idea, as much as they begin with
  an intuition or feeling about a direction I want to take. Strangely, I may find
  that intuition takes form most directly through working from a prior study drawing,
  or a photograph I’ve made previously.

  Switching to a large brush, loaded with dense ivory black oil paint, the dark shapes
  I made felt ominous, as though they were thrashing about, struggling in a web,
  trying to get free.

  Applying painting medium and powdered charcoal, and allowing it to flow through
  the paint and drawing, down the surface of the paper, I found that I had created
  a surprisingly regular mesh or grating. This prompted me to turn the paper on its
  side, continuing to create a delicate, irregular grid, with the individual cells
  each shaped by their unique local conditions.

  In order to distinguish a secondary system of more organic drawing from the given
  geometry of the grid, I began to draw with some beautiful ink made from black walnuts,
  given to me by a dear friend.

  This work went many rounds, ultimately incorporating clouds of white oil paint
  that bloom forward to engage the black, while the layers of drawing interlace themselves
  through the grid.
