  I began Covid #39, one of the later drawings of the series, in my outdoor studio
  with a heavy application of powdered charcoal along the top margin, as though I
  were superimposing waves, or graphing a curve.

  Powdered charcoal has a certain density, and it falls freely down the sheet, with
  some particles trapped by the safflower oil medium, and some drifting away in the
  currents of forest air. Somehow the movement of the medium has seemed utterly appropriate
  to the strange vertigo of the moment.

  Working with a stainless steel blade, I made a series of definite, identical gestures
  — as identical to each other as I could make them — pulling the blade from left
  to right, creating a small unit square.

  Where there is lots of charcoal, the geometry of the square is marked out and completed.
  As it thins out, towards the bottom, the gesture serves to produce a literal graph
  of charcoal density, and strange mountain ranges appear.

  There are no simple, isolated systems, however, and I wanted to indicate something
  like this by layering additional modes of mark-making over the first — pulling
  a thin layer of white oil paint across some squares, or applying a fine spray of
  cadmium orange pigment on others. The various particles mingle and intermix, creating
  sub-mixtures that flow down the sheet, coalescing into a single glowing square.
