  I began Covid #33, one of the later drawings of the series, in my outdoor studio
  with a heavy application of powdered charcoal along the top margin, as though I
  were superimposing waves, or graphing a curve.

  Powdered charcoal has a certain density, and it falls freely down the sheet, with
  some particles trapped by the safflower oil medium, and some drifting away in the
  currents of forest air. Somehow the movement of the medium has seemed utterly appropriate
  to the strange vertigo of the moment.

  Working with a stainless steel blade, I made a series of definite, identical gestures
  — as identical to each other as I could make them — pulling the blade from left
  to right, creating a small unit square.

  Where there is lots of charcoal, the geometry of the square is marked out and completed.
  As it thins out, towards the bottom, the gesture serves to produce a literal graphing
  of particle density, and strange mountain ranges appear.

  The great problem of abstraction is finding a way to make the world appear — in
  the midst of a series of technical maneuvers that might seem hopelessly distant
  from the actualities of life. It is here that I had the most difficult decisions
  to make: generating obscuring clouds of white that disperse and coalesce, and introducing
  a fine spray of cadmium pigment that gathers force unexpectedly, producing a block
  of orange that glows with the potential for contamination.
