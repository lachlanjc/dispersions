Christopher Campbell received his B.A. at Yale University in 1979, and studied with Ansel Adams in Yosemite in 1981. After completing his M.A. in art history at Brown University, Campbell received a Fulbright dissertation grant to France where he explored the artistic relationship between Cézanne and Pissarro. In 1990, he met Joan Mitchell in Paris. The encounter was transformative. Campbell shifted his focus from art history to painting, and moved to Vétheuil, France, where he lived and worked with Mitchell.

Returning to the United States in 1992 after Mitchell’s death, Campbell began the studio practice now drawing international attention. He has also taught art history, as well as painting, at the College of the Holy Cross, the University of Michigan, and the Pennsylvania State University. Campbell is often in demand as a consultant and a lecturer on color and fine art reproduction, and his paintings are increasingly sought after on the Asian art market. His work has been exhibited in China, Ireland, Spain, and the United States, including New York.

Campbell is represented by Nataliya Pissarro Fine Art LLC, New York, and Classic Gallery, Shanghai. He lives and works in central Pennsylvania with his spouse, Nancy Locke, a professor of art history at the Pennsylvania State University.
