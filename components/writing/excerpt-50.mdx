  With the paper taped to a panel, I started Covid #50 flat on the ground, as that
  facilitates casting a delicate tracery of lines across the surface. I knew that
  was where I wanted to start, even if I intended to finish in a very different place.

  To create a softer, secondary linear network that would occupy — and create — a
  different order of space, I worked with powdered charcoal, drawing with the panel
  oriented vertically, as though following particles in a cloud chamber.

  To contradict the graceful trajectories, I used a stainless steel blade — loaded
  with a mixture of ultramarine blue and ivory black — to establish a broken, erratic
  rhythm, chattering across the surface.

  Using slightly thinned white oil paint, I built an open grid that partially veiled
  the prior layers of work, obscuring some aspects, but allowing the denser, more
  concentrated drawing to bloom forward into the wet, receptive white.

  In the final session, I began drawing from a photograph of a mouldering oak, following
  aspects of the structural disintegration with a heavily loaded brush, leaning towards
  a dark, ragged mode that speaks of dissolution and collapse. Pulling paint and
  resin over and under the dark drawing modulated the degree to which it emerges
  organically from the quasi-geometric underlays, and presses the wet blackness towards
  not just unpredictability, but alarm and incomprehensibility.
