Last April, in this year of the plague, I found myself standing in my studio, watching the snow fall in the forest outside. Viewed through the lens of the pandemic, I saw the drifting snowflakes as the embodiment of the particles and aerosols we were learning about from the epidemiologists. I began to wonder I could reimagine aerosol gradients as clouds of airborne pigment? A bit of safflower oil, trickling down the face of a drawing, carries along the trace of everything it touches. Would this look and feel different now that we were all hypersensitive to "contact" as possible contamination?

Like many artists, I have such a deep interest in the materials, mechanics, and effects produced in drawing and painting. Working as I do with unusual materials — typically micro-thin dispersions of oil pigment in resin, pulverized pigments of graphite, charcoal or color — I try to be unusually attentive to the behavior of things on a fine scale, and I find their intrinsic behavior fascinating and beautiful. From there, it was but a short step to make a connection to a global pandemic that itself hangs on questions of particle size, dispersion, proximity and cross-contamination.

Suddenly, almost everything I do in the studio strikes me as having a metaphoric connection to the coronavirus. Using a language that I have cultivated for many years, I find that a delicate trace across the paper can come to seem like an aerial image of the circuits that people make as they move about within a city, while thoroughfares carved by flowing solvent appear like transportation nodes and trajectories. The largely unpredictable drip and flow of paint from an abstract square of color appears as a dangerous vector, while the hovering color itself strikes me as standing in for the data sets and statistical analysis overlaid upon us all daily.

I’ve never had a parallel experience to this series of drawings, in that I normally work from the phenomenal world — something definitively “seen” and captured, either in my own study drawings, a photograph, often both. Somewhat unusually in my studio practice, these are works of pure imagination, drawing from some set of intuitions about how not just the SARS-CoV-2 virus moves in the world, but how we live and move, and create networks that distribute science, misinformation, even confer immunity. What would it look like to visualize our individual paths and evolutions, what would we learn if we could actually see our “paths" and the ways in which they are inevitably overlaid, commingled, obscured, overtaken?
