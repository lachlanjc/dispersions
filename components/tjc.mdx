I’m beginning to absorb (no word is innocent here) the COVID drawings, which do seem to be some of your very finest work.  And as you say, decisively different from the work gone before, for all the deep continuities. The “imagined" quality you talk about must be part of it. But clearly the drawings are trying to imagine (to image, to give form to) the unimaginable, or at least to something dangerously, deceptively un-seeable — but a reality nonetheless, of dissemination, “infection,” “communication,” that is here with us, too close, too omnipresent. You are calling on the repertoire of marks and shapes and rhythms that have come out of long years looking to “face up to” an invisible (hidden) face of nature. The result is, as you say, a kind of certainty. Most “certainty” in art these days seems to me to be built on too flimsy a foundation — the artist knows what he or she is doing too soon, the tasks they've set themselves are too simple. Your certainty is different. It's what arrives when a “crisis” comes, and asks for a response, and a previous “language” and “procedure” is there, at your disposal — how it is, isn't clear, even to you — asked to do new things, asked to do things it might even previously have distrusted (like “drawing the imagined”).

What I admire most about the COVID drawings is (as maybe I tried to say previously) that their dangerous “abstractness” is obliged to admit that it is in search, naively, by fiat, in ways it doesn't understand, for the “feel” of a whole time... a time of vulnerability, contamination, loss of bearings, “being out of touch”…
