In April 2020, as the pandemic hit home, I suddenly had an intuition about a metaphoric connection between the behavior of the materials in my drawings, and the phenomena associated with COVID-19. I could no longer watch a sheet of paper trap a cloud of powdered graphite particles, or follow a rivulet of safflower oil as it gathered color on its travels, without thinking about aerosol dispersions or tangential infection.

What began as a few relatively small-scale drawings became a major, year-long project of some fifty works, largely executed on large sheets of Arches paper (130&nbsp;×&nbsp;92 cm, 51&nbsp;×&nbsp;36 inches). In the making, there was an exhilarating sense of generative urgency that seemed to lead nearly inexorably from one work to another. In retrospect, the drawings seem to fall into groups as the working process generated and accumulated new devices, modes, and feelings.
