My works don't begin with a subject or idea, as much as they begin with a feeling, and Covid #57 is no exception. I started drawing with a small brush at the end of a long, slender branch, working from a photograph of a shattered tree on a steep slope in the Rothrock forest. Switching to a large brush, and dense ivory black oil paint, the dark shapes
felt as though they were thrashing about, restrained against their will and trying to get free. Working with painting medium and powdered charcoal that I allowed to flow down the surface of the paper, I felt as though I had created a mesh or grating. Turning the paper on its side created a delicate, irregular grid, with the cells reshaped by their unique local conditions. I wanted to distinguish the more organic system of my additional drawing from the given geometry of the grid, and I began to draw with some beautiful ink made from black walnuts, given to me by a dear friend. This work went many rounds, ultimately incorporating white oil paint and additional powdered charcoal, applied and manipulated with a large stainless steel blade.
