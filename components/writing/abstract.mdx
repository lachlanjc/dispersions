In April 2020, as the pandemic hit home, I suddenly had an intuition about a metaphoric connection between the behavior of the materials in my drawings, and the phenomena associated with COVID-19. I could no longer watch a sheet of paper trap a cloud of powdered graphite particles, or follow a rivulet of safflower oil gathering color on its travels, without thinking about aerosol dispersions or tangential infection.

What began as a few medium-scale drawings became a major, year-long project of some fifty works, created on large sheets of Arches paper (130&nbsp;×&nbsp;92 cm, 51&nbsp;×&nbsp;36 in) specifically designed for oil paint. In the making, there was an exhilarating sense of generative urgency that seemed to lead from one work to the next. In retrospect, the drawings seem to fall into groups as the working process generated and accumulated new devices, modes, and feelings.
