  I began Covid #33 in my outdoor studio with a heavy application of powdered charcoal along the top margin, as though I were superimposing waves, or graphing a curve.

  Powdered charcoal has a certain density, and it falls freely down the sheet, with some particles trapped by the safflower oil waiting down below, and some drifting away in the currents of forest air.

  Working with the blade, I made a series of identical gestures — as equivalent to each other as I could make them — pulling the charcoal across a small unit square. Where there is lots of charcoal, the geometry of the square is completed. As it thins out, towards the bottom, the gesture serves to produce a literal graph of density and strange mountain ranges appear.

  There are no simple systems however, and I tried to indicate this by layering additional modes of mark-making over the first — pulling a thin layer of white oil paint across some squares, or applying a fine spray of cadmium orange pigment on others. The various particles mingle and intermix, creating sub- mixtures that flow down the sheet, coalescing into a single glowing square.
